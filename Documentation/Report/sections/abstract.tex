\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Estimating the size of an object is a task that humans can perform easily but struggle to explain the justification of. It is common sense to be able to estimate the size of an object. This dissertation project aims to create a database of objects with their commonly found sizes to assist software in being able to make these same estimates. The project will achieve this by using information extraction techniques to find written examples of objects sizes. The final system will be using named entity recognition and relationship extraction to extract this information from a text source.
