\chapter{Progress}

So far, I have created a basic machine learning model for named entity recognition. In order to help label training data for the models I have created a tool that allows me to quickly tag tokens in sentences as either objects or sizes. This also forms the base of the feedback tool I have created.

To assist with the initial capturing of data and to help the basic NER model I have researched into ways to make it more accurate without any initial training data. I have incorporated a model from the Python library NLTK that identifies part of speech (POS) tags for tokens. If the POS tag for a token identifies it as a noun, then the tool will flag this for human verification. Another way to assist the model is to use a gazetteer (list of known entities) such as Wordnet. If a token appears in Wordnet as an object, then it will also be flagged for human verification. Trying to identify sizes will initially be done with regular expressions as theyâ€™ll be accurate enough to provide training data without the need to have to implement a model. 

I have also started looking into potential data sources to extract our information from. Currently I am looking to English Wikipedia as a potential source.
